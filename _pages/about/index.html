My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for natural language, computer vision and reinforcement learning. I have worked on various problems such as:</p> <ol> <li>Natural Language Generation/Understanding</li> <li>Computer Vision</li> <li>Multimodal Understanding</li> <li>Reinforcement Learning</li> <li>Causal/Counterfactual modelling</li> <li>Time Series Forecasting</li> <li>Multitask Learning</li> </ol> <p>I did internships in Apple in Machine Learning Research team under Samy Bengioâ€™s team and worked as Applied Scientis intern at Amazon in AlexaAI.</p> <p>Currently, I am working on implementing a foundation model that self-introspects and makes a decision to recompute information based on internal states which is a combination of computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning where we try to simulate the actual thinking of human brain.</p> <p>I graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2018 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods for applying deep learning in blockchains under Prof. Chethan Sharma.</p> </body></html>
