I am a Graduate Student in the department of Computer Science at Georgia State University. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained diverse experience in deep learning. During my internship at Apple, I worked with the MLPT team and Siri team.  (where I worked on Queue Time Prediction to optimize and recommend task configurations. My project work led to a  93% prediction accuracy in distributed clusters. Furthermore, I worked with MLR team to developed a proof of concept for switching between local and distributed clusters, which aimed to reduced launch steps by 75% across all AI/ML teams at Apple. )
