Hello and welcome to my digital domain! I'm a seasoned Applied Machine learning engineer and a dedicated scholar in the field of deep learning, currently enriching my knowledge and skills as a Graduate Student at the Georgia State University. My journey in this fascinating world of artificial intelligence has been marked by diverse experiences, from groundbreaking research to practical applications that push the boundaries of technology.


At the heart of Silicon Valley, I had the privilege of interning at Apple, where I contributed to the Machine Learning Performance Team (MLPT) and the Siri team. My work focused on optimizing task configurations through Queue Time Prediction, achieving a remarkable 93% prediction accuracy in distributed clusters. This endeavor not only enhanced operational efficiency but also paved the way for a proof of concept that significantly reduced launch steps by 75% across all AI/ML teams, showcasing the transformative power of efficient computing.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was deeply involved in pioneering machine learning research at ARM Ltd., where my work spanned several key areas including computer vision, graph neural networks, natural language processing, and multimodal understanding. This experience allowed me to contribute to the advancement of machine learning technologies and their applications, further fueling my passion for innovation.

At Georgia Tech, under the mentorship of leading experts, I have delved into the complexities of deep learning architectures, focusing on implementing models with implicit differentiation and fixed-point iterations. My research is not just an academic pursuit but a mission to uncover new knowledge that can be applied to real-world challenges.

I am also passionate about sharing knowledge, which led me to design and teach an introductory course on deep learning, demystifying complex concepts for undergraduate students and inspiring the next generation of AI enthusiasts.
