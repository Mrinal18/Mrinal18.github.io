I am graduate student pursuing MS in Computer Science at Georgia State University. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for natural language, computer vision and reinforcement learning. I have worked on various problems such as:

1. Natural Language Generation/Understanding
2. Computer Vision
3. Multimodal Understanding
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Causal/Counterfactual modelling
6. Time Series Forecasting
7. Multitask Learning

I did internships in Apple in Machine Learning Research team under Samy Bengio's team and worked as Applied Scientis intern at Amazon in AlexaAI. 

Currently, I am working on implementing a foundation model that self-introspects and makes a decision to recompute information based on internal states which is a combination of computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning where we try to simulate the actual thinking of human brain. 

I graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2018 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods for applying deep learning in blockchains under Prof. Chethan Sharma.
